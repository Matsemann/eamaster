# EA Master

Repo for my Master's Thesis. Video, source code, compiled binaries and latex in the respective folders. See the [web page](http://master.matsemann.com/) for more info.

## License
Some of the code builds upon [MOEA Framework](http://www.moeaframework.org/), and therefore has to be released under LGPL. This code is inside `code/src/main/java/org/moeaframework`, as the modifications were done inline. The rest is released under the MIT License.
